        <div class="head">How to gain weight healthily</div>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          Putting on weight may be necessary for a person who is underweight. It
          may also be a measurable goal for someone who is aiming to build
          muscle. <br />
          <br />
          In general, consuming more calories than the body burns will result in
          weight gain. The calorie intake necessary to achieve this will vary
          from person to person. <br />
          <br />
          As a guide, consuming 300–500 calories more than the body burns on a
          daily basis is usually sufficient for steady weight gain. For more
          rapid weight gain, a person may need to consume up to 1,000 calories
          more per day. <br />
          <br />
          People who are trying to gain weight should also be mindful of the
          types of food they are consuming. For example, eating foods that are
          high in sugar is an easy way of increasing calorie intake, but it can
          also increase a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes. <br />
          <br />

        <div class="head">General tips for gaining weight safely</div>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          <b>Eat three to five meals a day</b> <br />
          <br />
          Eating at least three meals a day can make it easier to increase
          calorie intake. Snacking between meals can also help to increase the
          number of calories in the diet. <br />
          <br />
          <b>Weight training</b> <br />
          <br />
          Weight training at least three times a week is essential to healthy
          weight gain. This will aid in gaining and maintaining lean muscle
          mass. <br />
          <br />
          To continue gaining lean body mass, a person will need to vary and
          develop their workouts by increasing either the weight they lift or
          the number of reps or sets. Compound movements are one way in which a
          person can build muscle effectively. These include weight lifts that
          involve multiple muscle groups, such as deadlifts, squats, and bench
          presses. People who work out regularly must pay attention to their
          calorie intake to ensure that they are providing their body with
          sufficient fuel. <br />
          <br />
          <b>Eat enough protein</b> <br />
          <br />
          A diet with the right amount of protein will support muscle growth. In
          combination with regular weight training, consuming 0.8–2.0 grams of
          protein per kilogram of body weight will increase a person’s muscle
          mass. This is essential to healthy weight gain. <br />
          <br />
          Foods high in protein include eggs, meats, fish, nuts, and legumes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Eat meals with fibrous carbohydrates and healthful fats </b> <br />
          <br />
          Including foods rich in fibrous carbohydrates and healthful fats in
          every meal will help to increase the number of both calories and
          nutrients in the diet. These foods provide an essential energy source
          to maintain a regular exercise regime, and to support muscle growth.
          People should use whole-food sources of carbohydrates, such as brown
          rice and beans, rather than refined and processed sources. <br />
          <br />
          Distinguishing between healthful and unhealthful fats is vital.
          Healthful fats are generally monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats,
          which occur in foods such as nuts, avocado, vegetable oils, and fish.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unhealthful fats include saturated fats and trans fats. A healthful
          diet should limit saturated fats and avoid added trans fats. These
          types of fats are found in fried and baked foods as well as in fatty
          meats such as beef, pork, and lamb.

        <div class="head">Things to avoid when gaining weight</div>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          <b>Insufficient cardiovascular exercise</b> <br />
          <br />
          Some people stop doing cardiovascular exercise when they are trying to
          gain weight, but it is essential for maintaining a healthy heart,
          lungs, and brain. Running, swimming, and cycling are all good ways to
          get cardiovascular exercise. <br />
          <br />
          People keen to gain weight can try restricting cardiovascular exercise
          to around 20 minutes, three times a week, rather than avoiding it
          entirely. <br />
          <br />

          <b>A diet low in vegetables</b> <br />
          <br />
          Many vegetables are filling but have a low calorie content. However,
          it is crucial not to exclude them from the diet for the sake of weight
          gain. Vegetables are a vital source of vitamins and minerals and not
          eating enough of them may cause malnutrition. <br />
          <br />
          <b> Giving up too quickly</b> <br />
          <br />
          Safe weight gain can require patience and determination. It is not
          always possible to see results immediately. Everyone is different, and
          it may take longer for some people than for others.
