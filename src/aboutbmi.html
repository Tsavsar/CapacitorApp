        <div class="head">What does your BMI mean?</div>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and
          weight to work out if your weight is healthy.<br />
          <br />
          The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their
          height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
        </div>
        <div class="head">BMI ranges</div>
        <div class="text">
          For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range. <br />
          <br />
          For children and young people aged 2 to 18, the BMI calculation takes
          into account age and gender as well as height and weight. <br />
          <br />
          If your BMI is: <br />
          Below 18.5 – you're in the underweight range <br />
          <br />
          Between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range <br />
          <br />
          Between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight range <br />
          <br />
          Between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range If you want to
          calculate your BMI, try our

        <div class="head">Accuracy of BMI</div>
        <div class="text">
          BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a
          healthy weight range for a particular height. <br />
          <br />
          As well as measuring your BMI, healthcare professionals may take other
          factors into account when assessing if you're a healthy weight. <br />
          <br />
          Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as
          heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy
          weight even though their BMI is classed as obese. <br />
          <br />
          Your ethnic group can also affect your risk of some health conditions.
          For example, adults of South Asian origin may have a higher risk of
          some health problems, such as diabetes, with a BMI of 23, which is
          usually considered healthy. <br />
          <br />
          You should not use BMI as a measure if you're pregnant. Get advice
          from your midwife or GP if you're concerned about your weight.
