        <div class="text">
          To determine whether a food's acceptability changes with time of day
          and degree to which a food is appropriate for a given mealtime,
          preferences were obtained both in the morning and the afternoon for a
          set of foods which included items appropriate “for breakfast”, “for
          dinner”, or for either mealtime. A second purpose of the study was to
          determine whether such cultural rules regarding food appropriateness
          had been acquired by preschool children and whether the pattern of
          shifting acceptability with time of day predicted for adult subjects
          would also appear in the preference data of the children. Participants
          included 25 adults and 30 three- and four-year-old children. All
          subjects were seen twice, once in the morning and once in the late
          afternoon for two identical sessions. Half of the subjects in each age
          group were seen first in the morning, half were seen first in the
          afternoon. In these sessions food preferences for the set of foods
          varying in mealtime appropriateness were assessed and the foods were
          categorized as “for breakfast” of “for dinner”. The preference data of
          both the adults and the children showed significant preference shifts
          with time of day, with breakfast items more preferred in the morning
          than the afternoon and dinner items more preferred in the morning than
          the afternoon. These shifts were larger for adults than for children
          but not significantly so.
