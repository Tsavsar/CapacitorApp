        <div class="head">Why lose weight?</div>
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          There are many reasons for losing weight: <br />
          <br />
          Appearance: Some people may feel that if they lose weight, they will
          look more attractive, fitter, or healthier. <br />
          <br />
          Confidence and body image: Some people with excess weight or obesity
          may feel uncomfortable about their appearance. <br />
          <br />
          Overall health: Maintaining an appropriate weight can help to boost
          overall health and prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes. <br />
          <br />
          Specific conditions: Symptoms of sleep apnea or type 2 diabetes, for
          example, may improve or go away when a person loses excess weight.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fitness: A weight-loss program that involves exercise can leave a
          person feeling fitter, with more energy and stamina. <br />
          <br />
          Sports competitions: In some sports, such as boxing, an individual may
          seek to control their weight to stay in their existing weight
          category. <br />
          <br />
          Fertility: Fertility treatment appears to be more effectiveTrusted
          Source in women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) if
          they lose some weight before treatment. <br />

        <div class="head">When is weight loss bad?</div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="text">
          In some cases, losing weight may create problems. <br />
          <br />
          Weight loss happens when a person exerts more energy than they
          consume. This is called a negative energy balance. The body seeks out
          stores of energy, starting with fat, to make up the shortfall. <br />
          <br />
          In a person with little fat, more muscle and lean tissue will be used
          up. This can lead to further health problems. These include: <br />
          <br />
          A higher risk of osteoporosis <br />
          <br />
          Reduced muscle mass and strength <br />
          <br />
          Problems regulating body temperature <br />
          <br />
          A lower ability to resist infections <br />
          <br />
          A severe loss of body mass can be life-threatening. A person who is
          experiencing unexplained weight loss should talk to a medical
          professional if possible. <br />
