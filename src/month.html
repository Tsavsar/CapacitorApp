          <b>Cardio Segment </b><br />
          <br />
          Start with a 20-minute walk (or jog) on the treadmill or outside. Push
          your intensity to the point where you can feel your heart rate
          increase, but you can still talk (Borg scale 13-15). Before your walk,
          preload a podcast or playlist that is 20 minutes long.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Strength Segment</b> <br />
          <br />
          Lay down on an exercise mat (or lay in the grass outside and enjoy the
          extra benefit of natural vitamin D, which is known for boosting mood,
          energy, and the immune system). Lay on your back with your hands
          behind your head, knees bent, and your feet on the ground and squeezed
          together. Complete the following circuit:
          <br />

          <i> Crunches:</i> 25 reps regular crunches and 25 oblique crunches
          (twist rather than lift straight up with your chest) on each side, and
          then 25 more regular. Complete a total of 100 crunches.
          <br />
          <i> Back Extension:</i> Flip onto your stomach for Superman back
          extension lifts. 10 reps. Plank: Flip back over and do three 30-second
          plank holds on your knees. <br />

          <i>Bridges:</i> Flip back onto your backside, lift into a hip-bridge
          and hold for 60 seconds; repeat this 3 times. Keep your legs together
          and your pelvis lifted high (but not to the point of overexerting your
          back). <br />
          <i> Pushups:</i> Flip over one more time (assisted pushups on your
          knees are fine here). Do 3 rounds of 10 pushups.

          <b>Cardio Segment </b><br />
          <br />
          This week, you’ll add in intervals for 10 minutes of your 20 minutes
          of cardio. At the end, log the total distance covered. It should be
          longer than week 2. If it isn’t, you may need to increase your medium
          and/or your fast pace. Still rely on the Borg scale to verify you are
          not overexerting yourself (Borg Scale 13-18).

          minute <br />
